# Whitewalnut Café – Sales & Spoilage Optimization Dashboard

## 📌 Executive Summary
Whitewalnut Café was losing profit due to **product spoilage** and **low-margin items**, but decision-makers lacked visibility into the financial impact.  
Using Excel and Tableau, I analyzed sales and waste data to uncover margin inefficiencies and created an interactive dashboard that reveals exactly **where profits are leaking and how to recover them**.

📈 **Business Impact**
- Identified **$300+ per month** in profit recovery potential  
- Highlighted products driving **highest spoilage cost & lowest margins**
- Delivered actionable KPIs to support pricing and waste reduction strategies  

This project demonstrates **data cleaning**, **financial analysis**, **data visualization**, and **business storytelling** — turning raw café data into insights leadership can act on.

## ❗ The Business Problem
Cafés operate with **thin margins** — even small waste can destroy profitability.

Whitewalnut Café faced:
- Perishable inventory going unsold ➝ **spoilage cost**
- Popular items priced too low ➝ **margin leakage**
- No visibility into which products were hurting profitability

Leaders needed a **clear, data-driven way** to:
- Reduce waste
- Improve product pricing decisions
- Focus on profitable menu items

I built the solution below 👇

## 🔍 Key Insights Uncovered
✔ 3 products responsible for **60% of total spoilage**  
✔ Low-margin items driving **high volume but low profit**  
✔ Seasonal trends → demand forecasting opportunity  
✔ Simple price adjustments unlock **immediate revenue lift**

---

## ➕ Next Steps (If Project Continued)
To further support the café’s growth, I would:
- Implement **demand forecasting** using historical trends
- Build **automated alerts** for high spoilage items
- Introduce **menu engineering** to optimize product mix
- Connect to POS for **real-time margin monitoring**
- Expand dataset with **supplier pricing + labor cost**

---

## ⚠️ Project Limitations
- Data provided was limited to **one store location**
- No customer segmentation to relate margin to behavior
- Spoilage reasons not categorized (e.g., prep vs. expiry)

Addressing these would enable **more accurate profit modeling**.
