# Whitewalnut Café – Sales & Spoilage Optimization Dashboard

## 📌 Executive Summary
Whitewalnut Café was losing profit due to **product spoilage** and **low-margin items**, but decision-makers lacked visibility into the financial impact.  
Using Excel and Tableau, I analyzed sales and waste data to uncover margin inefficiencies and created an interactive dashboard that reveals exactly **where profits are leaking and how to recover them**.

📈 **Business Impact**
- Identified **$300+ per month** in profit recovery potential  
- Highlighted products driving **highest spoilage cost & lowest margins**
- Delivered actionable KPIs to support pricing and waste reduction strategies  

This project demonstrates **data cleaning**, **financial analysis**, **data visualization**, and **business storytelling** — turning raw café data into insights leadership can act on.

## ❗ The Business Problem
Whitewalnut Café has limited insight into spoilage costs and low-margin items, causing avoidable profit loss. A data-driven view is needed to support better pricing, waste control, and product decisions.

I built the solution below 👇

## 🔍 Key Insights Uncovered
✔ 3 products responsible for **60% of total spoilage**  
✔ Low-margin items driving **high volume but low profit**  
✔ Seasonal trends → demand forecasting opportunity  
✔ Simple price adjustments unlock **immediate revenue lift**

## ➕ Next Steps (If Project Continued)
To further support the café’s growth, I would:
- Implement **demand forecasting** using historical trends
- Validate the dataset in SQL to ensure accuracy before further analysis
- Connect to POS for **real-time margin monitoring**

---

## ⚠️ Project Limitations
- Data provided was limited to **one store location**
- No customer segmentation to relate margin to behavior
- Spoilage reasons not categorized (e.g., prep vs. expiry)

Addressing these would enable **more accurate profit modeling**.
